# MySQL ForumDatabase

This is a Database for Social media App more specific Forum.
The task was to build this Database with it's tables and 
connections and then Insert some data (A lot of data) into
the base. After that i had to make some queries to see that
the functionality of the Database is efficient. Then i made 
one function, stored procedure and trigger.

## No EER Diagram:
The reason behind why there is no picture or screenshot of
the EER diagam is that the base is not that small and all
tables cant fit into one picture. But no worries because
if u open the main File there will be a diagram of the base.

## How I did the Insertions:
The large amount of data was too huge to be inserted only by
myself (even with Copy -> Paste). So I made a research and 
found very proficient way to do it just for few minutes.
There is a website called "Mockaroo" (green cangroo) which
did very good job with the insertions. When you get into it's
page you only have to define the columns of your tables (Name,
type, etc.) After that you just define how many rows you want
to Insert and then you choose the type of the file you want.
In my case it was "SQL" format. Then you just simply press the 
"DOWNLOAD DATA" button and That's all. This method saved me a
lot of hours (maybe even day or two) writing Insertion queries.
