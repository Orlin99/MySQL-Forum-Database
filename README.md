## MySQL ForumDatabase

This is a Database for Social media App more specific Forum.
The task was to build this Database with it's tables and 
connections and then Insert some data (A lot of data) into
the base. After that i had to make some queries to see that
the functionality of the Database is efficient. Then i made 
one function, stored procedure and trigger.

# No EER Diagram:
The reason behind why there is no picture or screenshot of
the EER diagam is that the base is not that small and all
tables cant fit into one picture. But no worries because
if u open the main File there will be a diagram of the base.
